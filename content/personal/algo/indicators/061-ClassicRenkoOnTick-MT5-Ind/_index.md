## What are Renko candles?

Renko charts display price movement using "bricks" of equal size, ignoring time. A new brick is drawn only when the price moves by a specified amount. They help visualize trends by removing time-based noise.

## Parameters

- **BrickSizePoints** (20): Renko brick size in points
- **HistoryDepthSec** (3600): Historical data to initialize the chart (in seconds)
- **PriceSource** (Bid): Price source Ask(0) or Bid(1)

## Real-time Calculation

The indicator calculates Renko bricks on every tick. It initializes with `HistoryDepthSec` due to performance limits, so full historical Renko isn't shown.

## Time Scale

The Renko chart's X-axis doesn't match the main chart's time scale. Renko charts show price movement, not time. Interpret Renko sequences as price trends. `TimeDurBuffer` shows each bar's duration.

## Indicator Buffers

   1. **Open**: Renko brick open price
   2. **High**: Renko brick high price
   3. **Low**: Renko brick low price
   4. **Close**: Renko brick close price
   5. **Color**: Renko brick color (0 for up, 1 for down)
   6. **Time**: Renko brick start time
   7. **TimeDuration**: Renko brick duration (milliseconds)

## Trading ideas

### Consolidation breakout trading

Look for 2-3 bricks in a narrow range. Enter when 3-4 bricks of the same color appear in sequence. Place stop loss behind the last brick of the opposite color.

### "Brick wall" strategy

After 5+ bricks of the same color, wait for 1-2 bricks in the opposite direction. Enter when movement resumes in the trend direction. Place stop loss behind the last retracement brick.

### Support/resistance levels

Mark levels where brick direction changed 2-3 times. Use them as entry levels for market positions. Confirm with the formation of a new brick in the desired direction.
