SessionMA is a specialized Moving Average (MA) indicator for MetaTrader 5 that calculates the MA only on bars that fall within a specified session time window. Unlike standard MA indicators that calculate across all available bars, SessionMA filters calculations to include only the data points that occur during your defined trading session.

## Usage Tips

- For trading specific market sessions (e.g., London, New York, Tokyo), set the session hours to match the official market hours
- When analyzing long-term trends within specific hours, set a larger MA period and disable the "Session Only Intraday" option
- For day trading strategies, enable the "Session Only Intraday" option to focus only on the current day's session data
- The indicator works best on timeframes that provide sufficient data points within your session window (e.g., M1-H1)
