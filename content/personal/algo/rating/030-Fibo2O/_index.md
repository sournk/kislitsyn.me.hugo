## Requirements

Complete requirements are posted on the [task page](https://www.mql5.com/en/job/228450).

- [x] **The bot will have two entries.** 
    - Use inputs `FIB_STP_EPL`, `FIB_LIM_EPL` to set Entry point of each order. Other inputs set SL and TP.
    - The bot uses two different Fibo object:
        1. Fibo 1 for STOP orders.
        2. Fibi 2 for LIMIT orders.
- [x] **When price breaks structure, a high/low structure, the bot starts plotting the fib for a possible 76.4 buy/sell stop**
    - The bot uses `Structure Blocks` indicator to detect BOS and CHoCH using classic Smart Money way.
- [x] **76.4 order will be a buy/sell stop with SL at the 23.6 area and tp of 1:1 ratio**
    - Use `ENT_STP_RR` input to set another RR for STOP order.
- [x] **Second position will be a  limit order at the 100.00 area... In an uptrend, price breaks a high, the aim of this entry is to catch reversals after there is a run on liquidity..**
    - Use `FIB_LIM_EPL` input to set Entry Point for LIMIT order.
- [x] **The SL of this position is  going to be the equivalent of placing your 76.4 at the high/low** (Ask questions on this SL part, I will send screenshots)
    - The bot places Fibo2 on the chart so that level `FIB_LIM_EPL` matches level 100.0 of Fibo1.
- [x] **The SL of this second position will be the TP of the first position**
    - Use `FIB_LIM_SLL` input to set another SL level.
- [x] **The second position will have TP set at 1:5**
    - Use `ENT_LIM_RR1` input to set another RR.
- [x] **When the first position hit SL, the second position will move SL into a 1:1**
    - The bot changes TP for LIMIT pos using `ENT_LIM_RR2` when STOP pos reaches SL. If the new TP is lower than the current price, the position simply closes on the market with the current profit.
    - The bot deletes LIMIT order when STOP pos reaches SL and LIMIT order is still open *(WhatsApp chat: Once a the first order hit SL without triggering the second order, the second order becomes invalidated)*
- [x] **A prototype must be ready within 14 day's**
- [x] **Bot must work across synthetic indices and forex pairs**
- [x] **It must work across multiple timeframe**
    - ==The bot detect BOS/CHoCH and built Fibo only using `FIB_TF` timeframe on every new bar appears.==
    - You can change TF on your chart to have a best view, but detection BOS/CHoCH is always made on `FIB_TF` timeframe. 

!!! warning WARNING
    Every time you change TF on the chart bot deletes orders and builds new Fibo object again. All open pos are ignored.
    **So it's not recommended to change TF while bot is running.**
    
- [x] **It must be able to be turned off during rollover periods in forex**
    - You can stop the bot any time.
- [x] **Bot must have risk management settings**
    - Use `ENT_MMT` and `ENT_MMV` inputs.
- [x] **The presence of an ongoing trade should not prevent the bot from following the rules and placing new trades whenever the conditions are met**
    -    The bot operates only orders and positions with Magic ID set in `MSC_MGC` input. Ant other orders and positions are ignored.
- [x] In the mode 'FIB_MD'=SWING&SWING bot must rebuild Fibo only when current Swing "breaks" previous.
- [x] When STOP pos hit SL the bot changes LIMIT pos SL to equal value of STOP pos.
- [x] Orders should remain in the market after the Fibo updates.
